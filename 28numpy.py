# Numpy is used for working in the 2D or multi-dimensional arrays. So you need to import Numpy package to be able to work on multi-dimensional array.

# pip install --upgrade pip
# pip install numpy

# Example
from numpy import *
arr = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# To mention the type of the array we can write such as - int, float etc.
# This is 2D array below
arr1 = array([[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],[60, 70, 80, 90, 100]], int)

print(arr)
print(arr1)
