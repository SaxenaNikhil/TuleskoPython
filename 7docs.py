# Now in the interpreter type 'topics', so you will get the list of topics you want to know about in python
# After topics once you get the list of topics then maybe you can type one of the topic you want to get to know more about.
# lets say i want to know about the lists, so i will type 'LISTS' then it will give me everything about lists here.
# type in the same format as given in the interpreter such as if the topics are in capital letters then type the topic in capital letters only.
# Now to exit back to the command prompt just type 'quit'
